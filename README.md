# EncoordSample
Sample test project for Encoord company.

I asked to implement a hypothetical energy network. In this network, there might be some different elements such as network lines and nodes.
A gas network and an electrical network will share some common concepts so I made my implementation based on these common concepts and some specific features that are unique for each of them.
